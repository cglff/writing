# Value-centric Approach
It is important to focus on market efficiency and liquidity premium management. Different investment strategies should be employed for assets with varying levels of market efficiency.

A rational understanding of the essence of value and valuation is essential, paying attention to the dynamic nature of value and avoiding solely relying on a single method to determine valuation levels.
